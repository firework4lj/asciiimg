This is a tiny project of mine to help me learn about python and image handling. Its been pretty neat to play around with.
Coming from primarily c and c++, python has a lot of differences in syntax, which has taken some adjustment. 

Id like to do something more with this but for now this is it.

vidtoframes.py takes in a video file as its first argument. It then extracts each frame to a jpg file. Be warned, this can take up a lot of space.

asciiimg.py can take in either a photo or a folder of images created by vidtoframes.py. 
usage: asciiimg.py -f <folder>
or,
usage: asciiimg.py <image>

This then outputs the ascii version of the photo or video to the console. Neato.
